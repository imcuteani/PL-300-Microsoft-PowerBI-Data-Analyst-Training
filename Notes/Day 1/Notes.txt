data analysis lifecycle 

  - Identifying the correct data 
  - Cleaning the data (removing of duplicates, data profiling, column aggregation)  
  - transforming the data 
  - modeling of the data 
  
  
  Scenario of Descriptive analytics 
  
  - summarize the large semantic models to describe outcomes to stakeholders
  - using KPIs , the strategies can help tracking the success/failure of the key objectives 
  - Metrics like ROIs are used and used to track the performance objectives. 
  
  e.g. reports of sales/financial data of an org. 
  
  Diagnostics Analysis 
  
  - help us to answer questions about the event anomalies, data anomalies, unexpected results 
  - identify anomalies in the data. 
  - collect the data which's related to this anomalies 
  - use statistical techniques to discover relationships that can explain the anomalies
  
  
  Predictive analysis 
  
  - use the historical data to identify the trends and determine the possibility of occurance in future 
  - possibility of sales volume of an org for next 6 months
  - statitics and ML models like neural networks, decision trees and regression
  
  Prescriptive analysis 
  
  - org can make data driven decisions while using precriptive analytics and allows business to make informed decisions during uncertainty 
  - uses the ML models to find strategies and patterns in large semantic models 
  - By analysing the past decisions and events, org can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes. 
  
  Cognitive analytics 
  
  - effective cognitive analytics is based on ML models 
  - uses different ML / natural language processing concepts/algorithms to make sense of previously untapped data sources like Sales records data, 
  Call center logs, weblogs, clickstream logs, product reviews
